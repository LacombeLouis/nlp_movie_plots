# nlp_movie_plots
***Research Question***: Our aim during this analysis will be to see if we can differentiate the genre of movies according to their plots. We will specifically look more closely into 5 different genres, namely, comedy, action, horror, thriller and drama. Additionally, we will look at some of the differences when we add verbs and adverbs or if we leave them out.
